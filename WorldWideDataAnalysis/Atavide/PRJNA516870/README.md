# Title:
Time-resolved study on cystic fibrosis airways

# Description:
To understand changes in the lung microbiome, twenty-two subjects were followed over 15-months, focusing on exacerbation events. Sputum samples collected during medical examinations were sequenced after cell-size selection to minimize human contamination. This work reports functional (e.g. pathway distribution) and taxonomical (e.g. phylogenetic reconstruction) characteristics that were detected during the progression of the disease.

# Organisation:
University of Florence
