# Bioproject PRJNA1091195

This sample comes from the [NCBI BioProject PRJNA1091195](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA1091195).

# PLEASE NOTE: This is unpublished data we extracted from the SRA. We do not intend to publish this analysis without contacting the authors. Please do not use this data without checking the primary authors (see below).

# Title:
Metagenomic data from sputa from cystic fibrosis patients


# Description:
Microbial characterization of sputa samples from cystic fibrosis patients over the course of intravenous antibiotic treatment through whole genome sequencing. Comparison between short and long-reads sequencing platforms.


# Metadata:
We have included the metadata in two separate files, a [JSON format file](PRJNA1091195.metadata.json.gz) that is computer readable, or a [tsv format file](PRJNA1091195.metadata.tsv.gz) that you can import into excel or similar.


# Publications

This is an unpublished data set from Scott Bell's group at UQ. Please contact them if you wish to use any of this analysis or data.

# Analysis:

- The entire data set is 44 runs, and 146,735,286,366 bp (including amplicon sequences)
- We analysed 22 metagenomic sequence runs.
- We predicted 12 samples out of 22 (54.5%) have _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_
