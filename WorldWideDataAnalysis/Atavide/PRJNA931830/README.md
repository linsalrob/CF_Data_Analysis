This sample comes from the [NCBI BioProject PRJNA931830](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA931830).

# Title:
The metagenome of children with cystic fibrosis.

# Description:
This project is studying the longitudinal development of the metagenome in children with cystic fibrosis. Data has been collected from oropharyngeal swabs. Human reads have been excluded from the data by BBmap v38.84.


# Metadata:
We have included the metadata in two separate files, a [JSON format file](PRJNA931830.metadata.json.gz) that is computer readable, or a [tsv format file](PRJNA931830.metadata.tsv.gz) that you can import into excel or similar.
