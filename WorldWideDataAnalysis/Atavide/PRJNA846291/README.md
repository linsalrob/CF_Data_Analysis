# Bioproject PRJNA846291

This sample comes from the [NCBI BioProject PRJNA846291](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA846291).

# Title:
Longitudinal Cystic Fibrosis Airway Raw sequence reads

# Description:
1 year longitudinal respiratory samples


# Metadata:
We have included the metadata in two separate files, a [JSON format file](PRJNA846291.metadata.json.gz) that is computer readable, or a [tsv format file](PRJNA846291.metadata.tsv.gz) that you can import into excel or similar.

# Analysis:

- The entire data set is 98 runs, and 87,154,850,753 bp
- We analysed 98 metagenomic sequence runs.
- We predicted 1 samples out of 98 (1.0%) have _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_
