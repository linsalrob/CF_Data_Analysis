# Title:
Lung Microbiome Dynamics in Cystic Fibrosis

_Strain-resolved Dynamics of the Lung Microbiome in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis_

# Description:
In cystic fibrosis, dynamic and complex communities of microbial pathogens and commensals can colonize the lung. Cultured isolates from lung sputum reveal high inter- and intraindividual variability in pathogen strains, sequence variants, and phenotypes; disease progression likely depends on the precise combination of infecting lineages. Routine clinical protocols, however, provide limited overview of the colonizer populations. A more comprehensive and precise identification and characterization of infecting lineages could therefore assist in making corresponding decisions on treatment. Here, we describe longitudinal tracking for four cystic fibrosis patients who exhibited extreme clinical phenotypes and were thus selected from a pilot cohort of eleven patients with repeated sampling for more than a year. Following metagenomics sequencing of lung sputum, we find that the taxonomic identity of individual colonizer lineages can be easily established. Crucially, even superficially clonal pathogens can be subdivided into multiple sub-lineages at the sequence level. By tracking individual allelic differences over time, an assembly-free clustering approach allows us to reconstruct multiple lineage-specific genomes with clear structural differences. Our study showcases a culture-independent shotgun metagenomics approach for longitudinal tracking of sub-lineage pathogen dynamics, opening up the possibility of using such methods to assist in monitoring disease progression through providing high-resolution routine characterization of the cystic fibrosis lung microbiome.
