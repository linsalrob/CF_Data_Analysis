# Title:
Longitudinal changes on the oropharyngeal metagenome among children with cystic fibrosis after ETI

# Description:
This project aims to understand the longitudinal effects of the triple modulator therapy with elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) on the bacterial metagenome. 20 children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis eligible to ETI therapy (at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene) were included in this prospective study. Samples were collected at baseline and longitudinally for three months after start of ETI therapy. This study is of particular relevance, because CF disease progression is mainly mediated by colonization with bacterial pathogens and recurrent infections. The effects of ETI therapy on bacterial metagenomes were not studied in children with mild CF lung disease so far.


# Metadata:
We have included the metadata in two separate files, a [JSON format file](PRJNA1101448.metadata.json.gz) that is computer readable, or a [tsv format file](PRJNA1101448.metadata.tsv.gz) that you can import into excel or similar.
