# Title:

Human lung metagenome

_Sputum samples from cystic fibrosis patients Metagenome_

# Description:
We used a comparative metagenomic approach to explore lung bacterial communities of cystic fibrosis patients with different clinical conditions

# Metadata:
We have included the metadata in two separate files, a [JSON format file](PRJNA316056.metadata.json.gz) that is computer readable, or a [tsv format file](PRJNA316056.metadata.tsv.gz) that you can import into excel or similar.
