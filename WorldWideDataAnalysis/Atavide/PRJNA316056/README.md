# Bioproject PRJNA316056

This sample comes from the [NCBI BioProject PRJNA316056](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA316056).

# Title:

Human lung metagenome

_Sputum samples from cystic fibrosis patients Metagenome_

# Description:
We used a comparative metagenomic approach to explore lung bacterial communities of cystic fibrosis patients with different clinical conditions

# Metadata:
We have included the metadata in two separate files, a [JSON format file](PRJNA316056.metadata.json.gz) that is computer readable, or a [tsv format file](PRJNA316056.metadata.tsv.gz) that you can import into excel or similar.

# Publications

This is an unpublished study. Contact Giovanni Bacci, University of Florence

# Analysis:


- The entire data set is 12 runs, and 36,012,000,000 bp (including amplicon sequences)
- We analysed 12 metagenomic sequence runs.
- We predicted 6 samples out of 12 (50.0%) have _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_
