# Bioproject PRJNA839435

This sample comes from the [NCBI BioProject PRJNA839435](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA839435).

# Title:
Cystic Fibrosis Lung Sputum Microbiome before and after antibiotic treatment

# Description:
Here we examine the effects of antibiotics on the Cystic Fibrosis lung microbiome. We compare the metagenomes of before and after exacerbation events after antibiotic treatment on n=6 individuals.


# Metadata:
We have included the metadata in two separate files, a [JSON format file](PRJNA839435.metadata.json.gz) that is computer readable, or a [tsv format file](PRJNA839435.metadata.tsv.gz) that you can import into excel or similar.

# Analysis:


- The entire data set is 12 runs, and 8,336,976,960 bp (including amplicon sequences)
- We analysed 12 metagenomic sequence runs.
- We predicted 11 samples out of 12 (91.7%) have _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_
