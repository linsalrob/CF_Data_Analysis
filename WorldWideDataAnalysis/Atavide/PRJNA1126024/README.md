# Title:
Shotgun metagenomic data from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples of infants with CF

# Description:
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease characterized by persistent infection and inflammation that drive irreversible lung damage. Airway microbial diversity is higher in children with CF, evolving into pathogen-dominated communities as individuals age and lung function declines. Understanding the microbiome associated with infections is crucial due to their significant impact on population dynamics and antibiotic resistance. However, low biomass of clinical samples, particularly from the lower airways, precludes capture of microbes genomes in the lungs of infants with CF.

We have included the metadata in two separate files, a [JSON format file](PRJNA1126024.metadata.json.gz) that is computer readable, or a [tsv format file](PRJNA1126024.metadata.tsv.gz) that you can import into excel or similar.
