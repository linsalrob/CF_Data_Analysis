# Bioproject PRJNA316588

This sample comes from the [NCBI BioProject PRJNA316588](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA316588).

# Title:
Human lung metagenome

_Sputum Metagenome Of CF, COPD, Smokers And Healthy Subjects_

# Description:
Sputum samples were collected from healthy smokers and non-smoking individuals, Cystic Fibrosis and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease patients. DNA was extracted from these samples without any prior removal of human DNA and the samples were whole genome shotgun sequenced foracquiring an unbiased qualitative view of the microbial community present in thedifferent lungs.


# Metadata:
We have included the metadata in two separate files, a [JSON format file](PRJNA316588.metadata.json.gz) that is computer readable, or a [tsv format file](PRJNA316588.metadata.tsv.gz) that you can import into excel or similar.
