# Jupyter Notebooks

These Jupyter notebooks are the foundation of our analysis. To expedite analysis, minimise the amount of redundancy, and streamline things, we've created a library, `cf_analysis_lib` which includes the most common imports (e.g. pandas, seaborn, sci-kits, and several stats packages). This library also exposes several methods for loading the data cleanly, which
means that in each notebook we don't need to load and reshape the data.

## Figure List

These notebooks are for obviously exploring and analysing the data, but they are also key to making the figures for our paper.
